# Java Task Manager (Backend-Focused)

This project started as a simple console-based task manager and is being **intentionally evolved** into a backend-style application using professional Java practices.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Clean object-oriented design
- Separation of concerns
- Data persistence
- Gradual migration toward a Spring Boot REST API

---

## Current Features
- Create, view, update, and delete tasks
- Persistent storage (file-based)
- Task domain model with completion state

---

## Roadmap
This project is being developed in stages:

1. ✅ Introduce Task domain object (id, description, completed)
2. ⏳ Persist tasks as JSON
3. ⏳ Separate business logic and storage layers
4. ⏳ Convert console interface to Spring Boot REST API
5. ⏳ Replace file storage with a database

## Why This Project Exists
This repository is part of my journey to becoming a strong Java backend developer.
Each commit represents a deliberate architectural improvement rather than a quick demo.

## Technologies
- Java
- Git / GitHub
- (Planned) Spring Boot
- (Planned) REST APIs
